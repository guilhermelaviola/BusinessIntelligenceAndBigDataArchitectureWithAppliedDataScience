# Business Intelligence & Big Data Architecture with Applied Data Science
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Business Intelligence and Big Data Architecture with Applied Data Science, which is a comprehensive framework that integrates traditional BI's descriptive analytics of structured, historical data with Big Data's ability to manage and analyze massive volumes of diverse data (structured, unstructured, and semi-structured) in real or near-real time, using advanced data science techniques (like machine learning and predictive modeling) to generate forward-looking, actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
