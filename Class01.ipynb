        "# **Introduction to Data Warehouses**\n",
        "A data warehouse is a centralized storage system designed to consolidate, integrate, and manage large volumes of data from diverse sources, organizing them in a way that facilitates retrieval and analysis, essential for business decision-making. Big Data usually refers to extremely large and complex data sets that cannot be managed or analyzed with traditional tools and methods. It involves the collection, storage, and analysis of data from different sources with the goal of discovering patterns, trends, and correlations that provide competitive advantages. Together, the concepts of data warehouses and big data enable large-scale data integration and analysis, providing valuable insights for strategic decisions. However, it is important to emphasize that large volumes do not imply exclusivity for columnar databases, where information is organized in sequential columns. In fact, a data warehouse can accommodate unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. In this study, we focus on structured data, common in Business Intelligence (BI) tools, such as Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and SQL databases from systems like PostgreSQL and MySQL."

The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades.\n",
